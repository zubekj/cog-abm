    Storage of samples that represents knowledge about environment.

    :param float beta: how much weights of samples will be increased. Values from 0 (no strengthening) to infinity.
    :param float sigma: affects how factor of similarity affects strengthening of weights. \
        Value form 0 (similarity doesn't affects strengthening) \
        to infinity (the less similar samples the weaker strengthen).
    :param float max_weight: the maximum weight of sample. Value from 0 to infinity.

    Sample storage provides a way to represent samples known by agent and gives you a easy way to export this samples
    to format designed for machine learning algorithms.

    Every sample is associated with class of sample, environment of origin,
    category of sample storage (one sample can be associated with more than one category),
    weight of association to this category, which can affect removing of sample if weight is lower than fixed
    forgetting threshold.

    Each sample is represented as sample index in environment of origin at which is stored.
    It is result of concern about performance and memory usage.

    Each sample of the same category in sample storage has the same class. Every try to add sample with different
    class will result in creating new category and adding this sample to it.

    Weights can be increased and decreased but it will not remove samples from category directly. Even if weight of
    sample will drop to 0 (minimum weight), sample will be still part of category. To remove sample with weights lower
    than forgetting threshold, should be used methods remove weak samples and remove weak samples from category.

    Sample storage is implementation of the class described in Konrad Kurdej's master's thesis:
    "Modelowanie procesow poznawczych: konsensusowa metoda klasyfikacji z komunikacja miedzy agentami".
