There are two ways to use steels_main:

    - run from command line:

        python steels_main.py -f result

        which will run basic steels simulation and saves result file in cog_simulations/results_of_simulation/ directory

    - run from command line:

        python steels_main.py -p your_simulation_name.json -f results

        which will run simulation defined in file your_simulation_name.json that should be placed in cog_simulations/examples/simulations/ directory. Results file will be saved in cog_simulations/results_of_simulation/ directory.

Example simulation file:

{
    "dump_freq": 10,
    "num_iter": 1000,
    "num_agents": 5,
    "learning" :
    {
        "alpha" : 0.1,
        "beta" : 1,
        "sigma" : 1
    },
    "networks": [
        {
            "type": "Line",
            "start": 1
        },
        {
            "source": "graph.json",
            "start": 500
        }
    ]
}
